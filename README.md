==========

3d printed worm head part intended to superglued to a original metal slinky

why?

because it makes a rad worm puppet to go along with the 'herman the worm' storytime song

for durability's sake, slice with 4+ perimeters, 3+ bottom solid layers, and hella infill but you don't have to listen to me i'm not the boss of you
